Licensing

The JUCE framework is not free--it is commercial software which happens to be offered under a dual-license scheme. Its development is funded by people and companies who pay for a commercial license, which permits them to use it in closed-source projects. However, the developers are kind enough to allow it to be used without payment in open-source projects, provided these are offered under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL3). In accordance with this requirement, all the code examples published here are governed by the GPL3.

The GPL3 forbids unauthorized use of GPL-licensed code in closed-source projects, which in turn means that if you copy any part of a GPL-licensed program for use in another project, that project must itself be GPL-licensed and open-source. However, the GPL3 also states clearly that authorized uses can be exempt from these rules. This is what allows dual-licensing schemes of the sort used by JUCE, and also allows me to designate certain parts of these projects (of which I am the sole author and copyright holder) as being more freely usable under the MIT License.
